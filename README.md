This project involves scraping and analyzing Big 12 basketball team data from the 2023-2024 season. Using requests and pandas, I structured the data into a DataFrame and exported it to Excel for deeper analysis. The analysis includes advanced shooting stats, correlation heatmaps, and interactive scatter plots to visualize key trends. The project highlights Houston Cougars' defensive efficiency and rebounding dominance and uncovers trends like top teams excelling in AST/TO vs. OPP PPG metrics.
